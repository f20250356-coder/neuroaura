# NeuroAura

NeuroAura is a React Native + Expo app designed as a nervous-system–aware companion for neurodivergent teens (ADHD, autism, sensory sensitivities). It combines mood & body check-ins, passive sensor signals (movement, noise, brightness), and a neurodivergent-affirming AI chat companion (“Your Friend”) to detect overload early, surface patterns, and gently guide users toward simple, supportive next steps.
